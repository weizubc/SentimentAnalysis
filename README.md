# Twitter sentiment analysis using Python and NLTK
This project studies how peopleâ€™s sentiment is affected by weather.
* Pull real-time tweets data using the Twitter streaming API and track tweets from San Francisco. 
* Train a Naive Bayes classifier using downloaded Sentiment140 data with 1,600,000 training tweets and 359 test tweets. Results report 83.0% accuracy.  
* Use the trained classifier to assign positive and negative sentiment to tweets. Then compute the fraction of positive tweets for each hour as the measure of sentiment.
